              "text": "Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.",

Pluripotent stem cells exhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural organization, as microgravity optimizes conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expansion. This occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway activation, where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as BAD and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is also dynamically regulated in microgravity, promoting β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation, activating genes essential for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Additionally, microgravity modulates Notch pathway interactions and transcription factors like RUNX1, crucial for hematopoietic lineage commitment. Structural rearrangements in hematopoietic niches under microgravity alter cell-to-cell interactions and adhesion molecule expression, facilitating the three-dimensional organization of hematopoietic clusters. On a physiological level, microgravity-induced metabolic adjustments enhance responsiveness to hypoxic stimuli, promoting hematopoietic maturation. These findings underscore the potential of microgravity-based systems to refine cell culture techniques and provide insights into spaceflight’s effects on human hematopoietic function.",

This figure illustrates the complex impact of microgravity on various immune cell populations and key molecular signaling pathways. Exposure to microgravity leads to significant alterations in immune cell function, including a shift in macrophage polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Dendritic cells exhibit a reduced capacity for antigen presentation, while neutrophil numbers increase, but their functionality declines. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells is diminished, potentially impairing immune surveillance. T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production are also suppressed, accompanied by decreased expression of IL-2R. At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade and the NF-κB pathway, further contributing to immune dysregulation. These findings highlight the widespread and multifaceted effects of microgravity on immune system function, which may have implications for long-term space travel and astronaut health.",

This figure illustrates the diverse effects of microgravity on cancer cells, with a particular focus on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and thyroid cancer. Exposure to microgravity has been shown to increase apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells. It also alters CSC properties, leading to a decrease in pluripotency markers and an increase in differentiation. Additionally, microgravity induces structural changes in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, which may influence tumor progression. In thyroid cancer, microgravity reduces proliferation and overall growth, while also diminishing the malignant phenotype in follicular thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, despite these inhibitory effects, microgravity appears to increase the susceptibility of cancer cells, potentially enhancing their response to treatments, as suggested by the syringe graphic. These findings highlight the complex and sometimes counterintuitive influence of microgravity on cancer biology.",

This figure illustrates the broad impact of microgravity on various tissues and organ systems, highlighting key structural and functional adaptations. Microvascular endothelial cells exhibit inhibited proliferation, decreased IL-6 production, and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. In the liver, microgravity alters hepatic metabolism, leading to increased lipotoxicity, elevated angiopoietin levels, upregulation of lipid metabolism genes, and dysregulation of immune response genes. Intestinal homeostasis is also affected, with observed dysbiosis, endotoxemia, altered bile acid content, and increased levels of intestinal stress hormones. In terms of bone health and mechanotransduction, microgravity induces significant bone mass loss, accompanied by a reduction in actin filaments and decreased cell stiffness in osteoblasts. Kidney cells experience metabolic alterations, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, alongside increased expression of fibronectin (FN1), MMP7, and TGFBI. Reproductive cells are also impacted, with evidence of reduced egg quality, the loss of polarization in granulosa cells, and a decrease in microvilli in eggs. Additionally, cardiomyocytes exhibit increased maturation and functionality, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the formation of sarcomeres and Z-disks. These findings collectively underscore the widespread and system-specific alterations induced by microgravity, significantly influencing cellular function and overall tissue homeostasis.",

Furthermore, microgravity influences hematopoietic stem cell differentiation by activating specific genes and pathways, including RUNX1, which is involved in stem cell establishment, SOX17, which plays a role in maintaining pluripotency, and GATA3, which is crucial for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte maturation.
